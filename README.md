# PulseGuard: Real-time Crypto Market Anomaly Detection & Alert System

PulseGuard is a sophisticated system designed for detecting anomalies in cryptocurrency markets and providing real-time alerts. It leverages distributed Kalman filtering techniques applied to blockchain data streams, augmented with sentiment analysis, to identify deviations from expected market behavior, providing early warnings of potential market manipulation, flash crashes, or emerging trends.

This project aims to empower traders, investors, and regulatory bodies with advanced monitoring capabilities to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. By combining statistical analysis with sentiment insights derived from blockchain transactions and related social media data (simulated in this example), PulseGuard offers a more comprehensive and timely detection mechanism than traditional methods. The system is designed for scalability and robustness, employing a distributed architecture to handle high-volume data streams and complex computations efficiently. The core logic is implemented in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and maintainability, and is structured in a modular fashion to facilitate future extensions and customizations.

PulseGuard goes beyond simple price monitoring by incorporating blockchain transaction data and sentiment analysis to provide a holistic view of market dynamics. This multi-faceted approach allows for the detection of anomalies that might be missed by solely focusing on price fluctuations. The alert system is configurable, allowing users to customize the sensitivity and types of anomalies they wish to be notified about. Furthermore, the modular design enables integration with various data sources and notification channels, making it adaptable to diverse monitoring requirements. This README provides detailed instructions on how to set up, configure, and utilize PulseGuard to monitor the crypto market effectively.

## Key Features

*   **Distributed Kalman Filtering:** Implements a distributed Kalman filter for real-time state estimation of crypto market variables (e.g., price, volume). The distributed architecture allows for parallel processing of data streams from different exchanges and blockchain networks.
*   **Blockchain Data Stream Integration:** Processes real-time transaction data from simulated blockchain networks, extracting relevant information such as transaction volume, gas prices, and transaction types to identify unusual activity patterns.
*   **Sentiment Analysis Integration:** Incorporates sentiment analysis derived from simulated on-chain text data and social media feeds (simulated), associating market sentiment with price movements to detect anomalies that may be driven by market sentiment.
*   **Configurable Anomaly Detection Thresholds:** Allows users to define custom thresholds for triggering anomaly alerts based on statistical significance and sentiment scores. The thresholds can be adjusted to fine-tune the system's sensitivity to specific types of anomalies.
*   **Real-time Alerting System:** Provides real-time alerts via configurable channels (e.g., email, Slack, webhooks) when anomalies are detected. The alerts include detailed information about the anomaly, such as the type of anomaly, its severity, and the contributing factors.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture that facilitates easy integration of new data sources, analysis techniques, and notification channels. This allows for future extensions and customizations to meet evolving monitoring requirements.
*   **TypeScript Implementation:** Written in TypeScript to ensure type safety, maintainability, and scalability. The strong typing system helps to prevent errors and facilitates code refactoring.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language, providing type safety and enhancing code maintainability.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing the TypeScript code.
*   **Kafka (Simulated):** Used for simulating a message broker to manage the real-time streaming data from blockchain and social media sources.
*   **Redis (Simulated):** Employed as an in-memory data store for caching intermediate results and maintaining state information.
*   **NPM/Yarn:** Package managers for managing project dependencies.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/uhsr/PulseGuard.git
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    cd PulseGuard
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    npm install or yarn install
4.  **Build the TypeScript code:**
    npm run build or yarn build
5.  **Install Docker (optional):** Docker is required if you want to run the application within a container, if not, you may need to install and configure Redis and Kafka locally.

## Configuration

PulseGuard relies on environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the following variables:

*   `KAFKA_BROKER_URL=localhost:9092` (Simulated Kafka broker URL)
*   `REDIS_HOST=localhost` (Simulated Redis host)
*   `REDIS_PORT=6379` (Simulated Redis port)
*   `ALERT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com` (Email address for receiving alerts)
*   `ALERT_SLACK_WEBHOOK=your_slack_webhook` (Slack webhook URL for receiving alerts)
*   `ANOMALY_THRESHOLD=0.95` (Anomaly detection threshold  a value between 0 and 1, higher values make detection more sensitive)

## Usage

1.  **Start the application:**
    npm start or yarn start
2.  **Monitor the logs for anomaly alerts:** The application will continuously monitor the data streams and generate alerts when anomalies are detected. The alerts will be sent via the configured channels (email, Slack).
3.  **API Documentation (if applicable):**
    *Not Applicable for this particular simulation.*
    *However, if an API was implemented, provide endpoints and request/response formats here.*
